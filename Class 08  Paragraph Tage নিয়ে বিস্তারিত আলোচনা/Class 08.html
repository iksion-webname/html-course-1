            A person would be picked up, blindfolded and hands tied. His entire
            face would be covered and a hat placed over his head. Then it was
            off to the secret detention facility. This was a small windowless
            room with a bright light constantly burning. There was no way to
            distinguish between day and night. Sometimes the light would be
            switched off and the room would plunge into pitch darkness. The
            noise of the exhaust fan was deafening and no outside sounds could
            be heard.
